### Description :

A PHP Framework built to provide a complete new way of writing PHP web app. Example :

    $app.body(
        Tag::div( {class => 'container', id => 'root-container'},
            Tag::h1( "Welcome to my web app !" )
            .Tag::h2 ( "You can nest elements"
                .Tag::a("as easy as this"))));
    
    // Add headers at any place, nevermind if your server has buffer activated
    $app.header("Content-Type: text/html");
    
    // Never wonder again about placing elements in the right order, just say where you want it to be
    $app.body.before(
        Tag::span( {class => 'navbar'}
            "Some elements into my navbar")
            .$app::render("app-logo")); // Render ressources easily
            
    // Oops we forgot to include some CSS/JS ... nevermind
    $app.provide("angular.js", "dist"); // the app will automatically include JS from the best CDN
    $app.provide("style.css", "local"); // or include your files from the 'ressources/' directory

## [Avalam AI Game](https://github.com/snwfdhmp/avalam-ai-game)

### Links :

- [repo](https://github.com/snwfdhmp/avalam-ai-game)

### Description :

While the UI is totally broken (I tried SDL but this is definetly something I don't want to work with), the back-end part with operator overload inheritance over abstract class polymorphism, may be interesting. I plan to export this class-system to build a cross-platform simple UI library for C++.

```C++
// (GC means Graphical Component)

auto window = new GCWindow (); // creates a Window object

// Let's create 2 different displays (views)
auto menu = new GCDisplay();
auto credits = new GCDisplay();

// Let's create 3 graphical components ...
auto button = new GC(); 
auto title = new GC();
auto content = new GC();

// ... and add them into their corresponding view
menu.addGC(button);
credits.addGC(title);
credits.addGC(content);

// Let's show a display ...
window.show(menu);

// ... wait for 3 seconds
window.wait(3000);

// ... and change to another
window.show(credits);
```

This small example does not explain stuff like onClick(), onMouseOver() and other methods overloading, this will come when I'll have the time to.
